      <p>
        My name is Sylvia. I run the merchandising team at a ecommerce company
        called Tavour. In my job I do everything from project management to data
        analytics. In my spare time, I'm a current web developer bootcamp
        student at UW. And in my spare, spare time I forage for mushrooms, bike
        long distances, and try to remember to sleep.
